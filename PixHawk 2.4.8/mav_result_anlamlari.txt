0	MAV_RESULT_ACCEPTED	:
Command is valid (is supported and has valid parameters), and was executed.

1	MAV_RESULT_TEMPORARILY_REJECTED	:
Command is valid, but cannot be executed at this time. This is used to indicate a problem that should be fixed just by waiting (e.g. a state machine is busy, can't arm because have not got GPS lock, etc.). Retrying later should work.

2	MAV_RESULT_DENIED	:
Command is invalid (is supported but has invalid parameters). Retrying same command and parameters will not work.

3	MAV_RESULT_UNSUPPORTED :
Command is not supported (unknown).

4	MAV_RESULT_FAILED	:
Command is valid, but execution has failed. This is used to indicate any non-temporary or unexpected problem, i.e. any problem that must be fixed before the command can succeed/be retried. For example, attempting to write a file when out of memory, attempting to arm when sensors are not calibrated, etc.

5	MAV_RESULT_IN_PROGRESS :
Command is valid and is being executed. This will be followed by further progress updates, i.e. the component may send further COMMAND_ACK messages with result MAV_RESULT_IN_PROGRESS (at a rate decided by the implementation), and must terminate by sending a COMMAND_ACK message with final result of the operation. The COMMAND_ACK.progress field can be used to indicate the progress of the operation.

6	MAV_RESULT_CANCELLED :
Command has been cancelled (as a result of receiving a COMMAND_CANCEL message)
